## 🚀 Quick Start
```bash
pip install autolineage
```
```python
import autolineage.auto
import pandas as pd

# Your normal code - everything tracked automatically!
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
df_clean = df.dropna()
df_clean.to_csv('clean.csv')

# That's it! Lineage tracked automatically 🎉
```

## ✨ Features

- **🔄 Zero Manual Logging** - Track lineage automatically with zero code changes
- **📊 Visual Graphs** - Beautiful interactive and static lineage visualizations
- **📋 EU AI Act Compliant** - Generate compliance reports instantly
- **🪄 Jupyter Support** - Magic commands for notebooks
- **⚡ Multi-Environment** - Works in Jupyter, Python scripts, CLI
- **💾 Lightweight** - SQLite backend, no complex setup
- **🔐 Cryptographic Verification** - SHA-256 hashes for data integrity

## 🎯 Three Ways to Use

### 1️⃣ Automatic (Recommended)
```python
import autolineage.auto

# Just write normal pandas/numpy code
# Everything is tracked automatically!
```

### 2️⃣ CLI
```bash
lineage track my_pipeline.py
lineage show --format html
lineage report
```

### 3️⃣ Jupyter Magic
```python
%load_ext autolineage
%lineage_start

# Your code...

%lineage_show
%lineage_report
```

## 📊 What Gets Tracked

AutoLineage automatically hooks into:

| Library | Functions |
|---------|-----------|
| **pandas** | read_csv, to_csv, read_parquet, to_parquet, read_json, to_json, read_excel, to_excel, read_pickle, to_pickle |
| **numpy** | load, save, loadtxt, savetxt |
| **pickle** | dump, load |
| **joblib** | dump, load |

**Plus:** Automatic lineage relationships between files!

## 🎨 Visualizations

Generate beautiful lineage graphs:
```bash
# Interactive HTML
lineage show --format html --output graph.html

# Static PNG
lineage show --format png --output graph.png
```

Features:
- Color-coded by file type
- Hover for details
- Click to explore
- Export for presentations

## 📋 EU AI Act Compliance

Generate compliance reports with one command:
```bash
lineage report --format markdown
```

Includes:
- ✅ Complete data inventory with SHA-256 hashes
- ✅ All transformation operations documented
- ✅ Full lineage graph with verification
- ✅ Reproducibility instructions
- ✅ Regulatory compliance statement

Perfect for:
- EU AI Act Article 10 requirements
- Model governance and auditing
- Research reproducibility
- Team collaboration

## 🔧 CLI Reference
```bash
lineage track SCRIPT      # Track a Python script
lineage show              # Visualize lineage graph
lineage summary           # Show statistics
lineage report            # Generate compliance report
lineage clear             # Delete database
```

See [docs/cli.md](docs/cli.md) for complete reference.

## 📓 Jupyter Notebook
```python
%load_ext autolineage
%lineage_start

import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
df.to_csv('output.csv')

%lineage_summary          # Show stats
%lineage_show             # Display graph
%lineage_report           # Generate report
```

## 🎯 Use Cases

### Research Reproducibility
Track every step from raw data to published results. Never wonder "which dataset did I use?" again.

### ML Model Governance
Automatic compliance documentation for regulated industries. EU AI Act ready.

### Team Collaboration
Share complete data provenance with your team. Everyone knows exactly what transformations were applied.

### Debugging
Trace model issues back to data sources instantly. Full audit trail included.

## 🏗️ Architecture
```
Raw Data → [Transformation 1] → Intermediate → [Transformation 2] → Model
   ↓              ↓                  ↓                ↓              ↓
Tracked    Logged & Hashed    Tracked     Logged & Hashed    Tracked
```

- **SQLite Database** - Portable, zero-config storage
- **Function Hooking** - Automatic tracking via monkey-patching
- **Cryptographic Hashing** - SHA-256 for data integrity
- **Graph Generation** - NetworkX for lineage DAG

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Does this slow down my code?**
A: Minimal overhead - just file I/O tracking. Typically <1% performance impact.

**Q: Do I need to change my code?**
A: No! Just `import autolineage.auto` at the top. Everything else is automatic.

**Q: What Python versions are supported?**
A: Python 3.8+

**Q: Can I use this in production?**
A: Yes! It's lightweight and has minimal dependencies.

**Q: How is this different from MLflow?**
A: AutoLineage focuses on automatic data lineage (zero manual logging), while MLflow is a complete MLOps platform. They complement each other!
